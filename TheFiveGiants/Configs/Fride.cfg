			description = Someone was reviewing pictures from R&D's telescope and mistakenly called this moon Gilly. When the error was discovered, the kerbal was fired and this inspired the management to call the moon Fride, as a misspelled version of fired. This moon is also really close to Crimsonis and nobody understands why or how.
